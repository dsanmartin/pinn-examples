# Physics-Informed Neural Network for Temperature Equation

Learning how to implement a PINN using TensorFlow

## Progress
Starting with 2D heat equation,
$$
\dfrac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 T.
$$

The goal is to solve
$$
\dfrac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla T = \alpha \nabla^2 T + S(T).
$$

**Work in progress...**
